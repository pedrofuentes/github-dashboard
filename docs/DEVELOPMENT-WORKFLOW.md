## Git Worktrees for Isolation

Every increment MUST use a git worktree for isolation:

```bash
# Fetch latest main, create worktree with new branch
git fetch origin main
git worktree add .worktrees/feature-name -b feature/feature-name main

# Change into the worktree
cd .worktrees/feature-name

# If worktree already exists (retry/recovery), just cd into it
# git worktree list  # check existing worktrees

# List active worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove a worktree when done (after merge — cd back to main worktree first)
cd <main-worktree-root>
git worktree remove .worktrees/feature-name
git branch -D feature/feature-name
```

### Why Worktrees Are Required
- Prevents interference between parallel work
- Each agent/increment has a clean working directory
- No risk of uncommitted changes from one task affecting another
- Easy cleanup after merge

## Branching Details

### Branch Lifecycle
1. Fetch latest: `git fetch origin main`
2. Create worktree + branch from `main`: `git worktree add .worktrees/name -b feature/name main && cd .worktrees/name`
3. TDD: write failing tests, implement, refactor
4. Commit following the format in AGENTS.md
5. Push branch: `git push -u origin feature/name`
6. Open PR: `gh pr create` or via GitHub UI
7. Invoke Sentinel for review
8. Address any Sentinel feedback, re-submit
9. On Sentinel approval, merge to `main`
10. Cleanup: `cd <main-root> && git worktree remove .worktrees/name && git branch -D feature/name`

### Branch Naming Convention
| Prefix | Use For |
|--------|---------|
| `feature/` | New features |
| `fix/` | Bug fixes |
| `refactor/` | Code refactoring |
| `docs/` | Documentation changes |
| `test/` | Test additions or fixes |
| `chore/` | Build, CI, dependency updates |

## Pull Request Process

### Before Opening a PR
1. All tests pass in the worktree
2. Linting passes
3. Commit messages follow the format
4. PR represents a single logical unit

### PR Title Format
`type(scope): Short description`

### Sentinel Review
→ See [`docs/SENTINEL.md`](./SENTINEL.md) for the full process and invocation methods.

### After Merge
```bash
cd <main-worktree-root>
git worktree remove .worktrees/feature-name
git branch -D feature/name
git pull origin main
```
- Start next increment from the plan
- If other worktrees are in progress, rebase them: `cd .worktrees/other && git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main`

## Sub-Agent Delegation

### When to Delegate
- Complex research that requires deep analysis
- Documentation generation
- Test data creation or fixture generation
- Performance profiling and optimization analysis
- Security vulnerability assessment

### How to Delegate
- Provide the sub-agent with full context (requirements, constraints, relevant code)
- Each sub-agent works in its own context
- Integrate sub-agent output back into the main work
- All sub-agent output must follow AGENTS.md rules

## Environment Setup

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+ and npm.

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/pedrofuentes/github-dashboard && cd github-dashboard`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the dev server: `npm run dev` (Vite serves the SPA locally).
4. Create a **fine-grained, read-only Personal Access Token** on GitHub (read-only scopes for metadata, Actions, contents, issues, pull requests, and security alerts) and paste it into the app when prompted. The token is stored in the browser only and never leaves it except for calls to GitHub-owned origins.

**Environment variables:** none required — the app is fully client-side and self-contained. Never commit tokens or secrets.

**Recommended editor setup:** VS Code with the ESLint and Prettier extensions; enable "format on save" to match the enforced code style.
